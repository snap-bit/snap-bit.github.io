The snap:bit is an electronic component for the Snap Circuits educational electronic kit. It features a socket for connecting the BBC micro:bit. This allows the Snap Circuits to be programmatically controlled by the micro:bit.

All features of the micro:bit like the accelerometer and compass, the light and temperature sensors, the radio and Bluetooth, are available for a completely new experience with Snap Circuits!

Projects
--------
The snap:bit comes with a [list of projects](projects) designed to guide you with the first steps of using the BBC micro:bit and Snap Circuits together. The projects are easy to learn block diagrams using the [MakeCode Editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/).

The variety of projects ranges from easy lessons to more complex and exciting projects. Although they teach lots of basic programming concepts and take advantage of most micro:bit features and Snap Circuits components, the possibility of projects are limited only by the kid's imagination!
